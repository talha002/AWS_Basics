# AWS Basics

This repo is created to show how to setup and use AWS basics services such as Amazon CLI, IAM & EC2. All documents are taken from Erkan Åžirin's [AWS Data Engineering training](https://bootcamp.veribilimiokulu.com/bootcamp-programlari/aws-cloud-data-engineering-bootcamp/).

If you want to know more about these services  follow my medium and look at my article about [AWS Data Engineering: Basics]().
